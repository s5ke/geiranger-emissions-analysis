# Geiranger-Fjord: Analysis of ship-related emissions
Scripts for analysing and modelling ship emissions in the Geiranger-Fjord, Norway

# Info
Ship-related emissions significantly contribute to local air pollution. Here, we did in-depth analysis on the atmospheric residence time of PM2.5 and associated meteorological influences.

# Data
The analysis is based on long-term air quality monitoring (PM2.5 concentrations) in the Western Norwegian fjord landscape from five
consecutive years (2015-2019). Modeled and observed PM2.5 concentrations were related to meteorological variables along an elevational gradient. 

# Methods
- correlation analyses, including a moving window to incorporate a time lag between ship emissions and subsequent PM2.5 concentrations.
- time lag correlation combined with a cluster analysis of selected meteorological
variables to examine the effects of occurring weather conditions after the shipsâ€™
appearance at port.
- linear mixed effects models
